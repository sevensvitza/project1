//*I made some adjustments to int input, brightness level/fade amount, and delay.
//

int led_1 = 3;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int led_2 = 5;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int led_3 = 6;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int led_4 = 9;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int led_5 = 10;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int led_6 = 11;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int led_7 = 12;           // I added this PWM pin

//I customized the brightness for most of these int (*)
int brightness_1 = 100;    // how bright the LED is *
int brightness_2 = 50;    // how bright the LED is *
int brightness_3 = 10;    // how bright the LED is *
int brightness_4 = 50;    // how bright the LED is
int brightness_5 = 50;    // how bright the LED is *
int brightness_6 = 50;    // how bright the LED is *
int brightness_7 = 100;   // customized *

//needed to adjust the fade amount to affect the brightness
int fadeAmount_1 = 10;    // how many points to fade the LED by
    // how many points to fade the LED by
int fadeAmount_3 = 20;    // how many points to fade the LED by *
int fadeAmount_4 = 10;    // how many points to fade the LED by *
int fadeAmount_5 = 10;    // how many points to fade the LED by
int fadeAmount_6 = 10;    // how many points to fade the LED by
int fadeAmount_7 = 10;    // *


// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  pinMode(led_1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led_2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led_3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led_4, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led_5, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led_6, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led_7, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // set the brightness of pin 9:
  analogWrite(led_1, brightness_1);
  analogWrite(led_2, brightness_2);
  analogWrite(led_3, brightness_3);
  analogWrite(led_4, brightness_4);
  analogWrite(led_5, brightness_5);
  analogWrite(led_6, brightness_6);
  analogWrite(led_7, brightness_7);

  // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
  brightness_1 = brightness_1 + fadeAmount_1;
  brightness_3 = brightness_3 + fadeAmount_3;
  brightness_4 = brightness_4 + fadeAmount_4;
  brightness_5 = brightness_5 + fadeAmount_5;
  brightness_6 = brightness_6 + fadeAmount_6;
  brightness_7 = brightness_7 + fadeAmount_7;

  //added an extra var for the last output
  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
  if (brightness_1 <= 20 || brightness_1 >= 205) {
    fadeAmount_1 = -fadeAmount_1;
  } if (brightness_3 <= 10 || brightness_3 >= 180) {
    fadeAmount_3 = -fadeAmount_3;
  } if (brightness_4 <= 15 || brightness_4 >= 210) {
    fadeAmount_4 = -fadeAmount_4;
  } if (brightness_5 <= 10 || brightness_5 >= 200) {
    fadeAmount_5 = -fadeAmount_5;    
  } if (brightness_6 <= 20 || brightness_6 >= 240) {
    fadeAmount_6 = -fadeAmount_6; 
  } if (brightness_7 <= 20 || brightness_7 >= 180) { 
    fadeAmount_7 = -fadeAmount_7; 
  } 
  //changed the delay time
  // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
  delay(50);
}
